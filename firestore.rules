/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the EMA application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user-specific data,
 * while allowing public read access to shared resources like exam definitions.
 * The rules prioritize security and data isolation, ensuring that users can only
 * access their own data and preventing unauthorized modifications.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profiles, accessible only by the user themselves.
 * - /exams/{examId}: Stores exam definitions, publicly readable.
 * - /users/{userId}/uploads/{uploadId}: Stores user-uploaded files and metadata.
 * - /users/{userId}/analyses/{analysisId}: Stores AI analysis results for user uploads.
 * - /users/{userId}/logs/{logId}: Stores user-specific logs.
 * - /logs/{logId}: Stores system-wide logs.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is disallowed to protect user privacy.
 * - Exam definitions are publicly readable to facilitate easy access to exam information.
 * - All write operations on user-specific data are restricted to the owning user.
 * - Global logs can be created by anyone, but cannot be listed publicly.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The `Upload` and `Analysis` entities include a `userId` field, denormalized from
 *   the parent `/users/{userId}` path, to allow for efficient authorization checks
 *   without requiring additional reads.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * - User-specific data is stored under the `/users/{userId}` path to enforce
 *   ownership-based access control. Publicly readable data (e.g., exam definitions)
 *   is stored in a top-level collection.
